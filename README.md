# TOP-Etch
Etch-A-Scketch Project from The Odin Project

Basic functionalities:
-The main container should start with a 16 by 16 grid.
-The main container should remain 960 throughout.
-There should be a button that prompts the user to input their desired grid size.
--There should be a limit of 100 square.
--The grid should be equally wide as heigh, so max size is 100x100.

Potential Add-On Challenges for the Project [Add three button on bottom of grid to change between settings]
-Randomize the color of the color that is used per square.
-Each square should only increase the black opacity per 10%, until after 10 iterations it's completely black.
